# Repository structure and document ownership

This file owns repository layout and documentation responsibilities. The versioned
[shared contract](standards/repository/v1/contract.json), its adjacent schemas and
[design](docs/development/repository-standard-design.md) own cross-repository automation
interfaces. `repository-standard.json` supplies Repo Pilot's adapter values; run
`python scripts/check_repository_standard.py` to check them. Shared files are vendored,
with hashes in `standards/repository/v1/bundle.json`; runtime sibling imports are prohibited.

## Layout

| Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/repo_pilot/` | Importable tooling runtime and installed CLI |
| `install.py`, `configure.py`, `knowledge.py` | Small source-checkout launchers |
| `setup_tooling.py`, `docker_install.py` | Machine/container setup entry points |
| `project/` | Single authored consumer payload, including standalone tools |
| `preset/`, `extension/` | Authored additions to official Spec Kit |
| `src/build_support.py` | Wheel assembly from those authored payloads |
| `tests/` | Distribution tests; standalone consumer tests remain with their tools |
| `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/` | Quality and release automation |
| `standards/repository/v1/` | Pinned shared contract and provenance |
| `docs/user/`, `docs/development/` | User guides and detailed design |

The wheel includes its payload. Editable/source execution reads the authored root
payload; it does not maintain a generated source copy. See [architecture](docs/architecture.md).
Builds, credentials, caches, overrides and generated evidence remain ignored local state.

## Documentation ownership

| Owner | Sole responsibility |
|---|---|
| [README.md](README.md) | Product entry point and links to guides |
| [PURPOSE.md](PURPOSE.md) | Mission, scope and non-goals |
| [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md), [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) | Tutorial and installation methods respectively |
| [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) | Current capabilities and functional limitations |
| [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) | Latest tested revision/delta, commands, results and unverified scope |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Milestones and acceptance criteria |
| [TODO.md](TODO.md) | Open actionable work |
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Contributor setup and review expectations |
| [BRANCHING.md](BRANCHING.md) | Shared branch/version convention |
| [CI.md](CI.md) | Local/hosted quality commands, matrix and evidence consumption |
| [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) | Repo Pilot version mirrors, release commands, App configuration and recovery |
| [GitHub setup](docs/development/github-policy-setup.md) | Hosted rules and activation setup |
| [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) | Safe resumption and protected inputs |
| [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) | Navigation |
| [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | Runtime components and resource ownership |

Legal and community procedures remain in LICENSE, NOTICE.md, SECURITY.md,
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and SUPPORT.md. Runtime instructions stay at their loader-defined paths.

When policy changes, edit its owner and link from summaries. Do not copy operational
rules, dated test counts or hosted activation state into README, STATUS or HANDOFF.
Replace current validation when requalifying; use Git history for older validation
evidence instead of maintaining a documentation-history directory. Historical review
reports likewise belong in Git history; retain current decisions and tasks in their
authoritative documents.
